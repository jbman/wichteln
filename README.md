wichteln
========

Wichteln is a mail sending program for a [Secret Santa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa) lottery. In german this is called [Wichteln](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichteln) and the participants are called "Wichtel". With this program each "Wichtel" gets an email with the name of a another Wichtel. The giving Wichtel should prepare a present for the person in the eamil. 

The program currently supports mailing with a web.de mail account (but it can probably be extended to use another)
